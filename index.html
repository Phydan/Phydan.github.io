                <p>My name is Davy. I am a sophomore at UW-Madison majoring in Computer Science. 
                <br>I like reading, as well as playing games during my free time, mostly with my friends rather than alone.     
                <br>During this 2024 summer vacation, I went to my home country spending time with my friends in unknown cities and villages around us.
                <br>I also love animals: cats, dogs, raccoons, andâ€¦ squirrel. </p>
